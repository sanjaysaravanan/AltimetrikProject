# AltimetrikProject
 my first project in core java 
 this project is about accounts payable through invoice which is a pdf the program parse 
 the pdf and finds the content as invoice number, invoice date, customer p.o, address, final amount
 then it stores the data in the database and the user interface will give the options to see the 
 invoice details and approve the invoice amount, if any invoice is approved then an acknowledge mail
 will be sent to the corresponding vendor.
